# Rename Images

A python script I made because I needed to rename images based on the current directory I was in and it took forever to do by hand so here it is. It also removes the extension -min which is added when I compress them from this site: https://imagecompressor.com

You can use it as well by changing the "rootdir" in the .py file.
